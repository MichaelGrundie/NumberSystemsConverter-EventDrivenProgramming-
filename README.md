# ProjNumberSystemsConverter

Foundation Degree - Science in Computing

Event Driven Programming

For the final assignment of year 1, I was tasked with designing
and implementing a program that would convert numbers between
number systems. I had to determine the user requirements from 
the client(Northern Regional College Computing Department.)
I then had to plan and document the process before writing
this code as the implementation.
